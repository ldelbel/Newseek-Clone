# Newsweek.com Clone - Responsive Bootstrap 4 Website

> In this project, I explored the Bootstrap 4 tools to build a newsweek.com clone.
> Bootstrap Grid Layout and pre-defined CSS Classes were applied to achieve this goal.
> Also this project was used to improve classes organization and the application and understanding of alternative classes structuring (inspired by both OOCS and BEM classes naming methods)
